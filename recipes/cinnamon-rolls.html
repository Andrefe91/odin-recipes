    <h2 class="Title">Directions:</h2>

    <div class="list wide">
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Prepare dough: Place milk, eggs, margarine, flour, salt, white sugar, and yeast in the pan of a bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select dough cycle; press Start.</p>
    
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>When dough has doubled in size, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Cover it with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let it rest for 10 minutes.</p>
    
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>Roll dough on a lightly floured surface to a 16x21-inch rectangle.</p>
    
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>Prepare filling: Combine brown sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Spread softened butter over the dough, then sprinkle cinnamon-sugar mixture evenly over top.</p>
    
        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <p>Starting at the longer end, roll up the dough; cut into 12 rolls. Place rolls in a lightly greased 9x13-inch baking pan. Cover and let rise until nearly doubled, about 30 minutes.</p>
    
        <h3>Step 6</h3>
        <p>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</p>
    
        <h3>Step 7</h3>
        <p>Bake rolls in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes.</p>
    
        <h3>Step 8</h3>
        <p>While rolls are baking, prepare icing: Beat confectioners' sugar, butter, cream cheese, confectioners' sugar, vanilla, and salt until creamy.</p>
    
        <h3>Step 9</h3>
        <p>Spread icing on warm rolls before serving.</p>
