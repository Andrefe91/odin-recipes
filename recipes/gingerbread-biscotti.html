    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>¼ cup molasses</li>
        <li>2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons ground ginger</li>
        <li>¾ tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon ground cloves</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>

    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a cookie sheet.</p>

    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>In a large bowl, mix together oil, sugar, eggs, and molasses. In another bowl, combine flours, baking powder, ginger, 
        cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg; mix into egg mixture to form a stiff dough.</p>

    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Divide dough in half, and shape each half into a roll the length of the cookie. Place rolls on cookie sheet, and 
        pat down to flatten the dough to 1/2 inch thickness.</p>

    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove from oven, and set aside to cool.</p>

    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>When cool enough to touch, cut into 1/2 inch thick diagonal slices. Place sliced biscotti on cookie sheet, 
        and bake an additional 5 to 7 minutes on each side, or until toasted and crispy.</p>
